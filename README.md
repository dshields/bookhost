Once completed, this app should let you play public domain books and pickup where you left off.

##Requires
   Vagrant and Virtual box

##Building
   Run build.sh. This will take some time the first time since it will build a development vm.

   After running build.sh you can browse to http://localhost:8080/bookhost to play your book

##Status 
   Will play a single mp3 right now. The app will not currently pick up where it left off.
